> A Tableland Studio command line tool.

## Background

Your first step is probably going to be either running the `init` command (`npx studio init`), or to login (`npx studio login --privateKey <include the private key you used to create your studio account>`).
Note that the `init` command will ask you some questions, and potentially store your private key in the `.tablelandrc.json` [config file](https://docs.tableland.xyz/studio/cli#config). If you pass your private key to the `login` command we won't store your private key anywhere.
If you plan to submit blockchain transactions via the cli you will probably want to store your private key in the config file, if you don't plan to send transactions you only need your private key to login, and there's no need to store it in the config file.

At this point you are ready to use all the cli commands. Refer to the [docs](https://docs.tableland.xyz/studio/cli) for the most recent usage recommendations. If you have any problems you can open an issue here, or chat with us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/kjgrnPhs).
